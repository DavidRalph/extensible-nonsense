# Extensible Nonsense

## Premise
What if edit conflicts were not a bug, but a feature?  

In email chains, forum threads, and real-time messaging alike, it is common for a new response to be posted while you are typing a reply to the previous message.
This can result in diverging conversations happening simultaneously in the same thread. What if they instead split into different threads? 

Extensible Nonsense embraces this idea for divergent storytelling.  

## How it works
Users are presented with the last entry from the story so far as a writing prompt, based on which they contribute the next entry. 
Their contribution is always added to the story immediately following the entry they were shown as a prompt. 
If multiple users were working from the same prompt, the story branches, with each of the new entries being the head of a branch.
A random branch of the story is chosen as the prompt on each visit.
